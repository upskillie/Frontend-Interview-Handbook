# Implementation

- In the react component, there is a prop `data` which is a long string containing some text along with custom xml tags (e.g. : `<div>this is some text<tag1>some text inside tag1</tag2><tag2>tag2</tag2></div>`). You need to render this on UI by rendering the tags. The tags can be html or non-html tags. In case of non-html tags, you have to convert them into div/span/p etc (mapping will be provided). What are the ways to do it avoiding possible security issues?

- Create a input type and a progress bar (or a loader). Initially the progress bar shouldn't be filled. Take the value from user in input and accordingly fill the progress bar in percentage. Bonus points if progress bar has css animation. You can assume that values will be in range 0-100. 

# Design based

- Design a website for user portfolio for stocks. It should have the following functionality:
  - User signin/signup functionality
  - A page showing the stocks owned by user along with functionality to buy and sell his stocks as well as allowing him to purchase new stocks
  Key points to focus:
    - What will be API end points and structure?
    - What will be the code and folder structure for frontend repository?
    - How will the react components be designed so that they can be re-used?
    - How will the redux store be designed?
